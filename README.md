Stalky is an app that allowed people to rate other people on a 1-5 scale rating. It is a yelp for people or a RateMyProfessor for regular people.

Basically, this is an app where you can rate anyone you want anyway you want. If they're a good person, they get good ratings and if theyre a bad person they get bad ratings(just like RateMyProf).
